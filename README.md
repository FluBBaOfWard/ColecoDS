# ColecoDS
ColecoDS - An Emulator for the DS/DSi

To run requires a coleco.rom bios to 
be in the same directory as the emulator
or else in /roms/bios or /data/bios

This is a work-in-progress... more readme coming
soon.

Special thanks to Alekmaul who provided the 
baseline code to work with and to lobo
for the menu graphical design.
