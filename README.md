ColecoDS - An Emulator for the DS/DSi

(c) 2021 by wavemotion-dave

To run requires a coleco.rom bios to 
be in the same directory as the emulator
or else in /roms/bios or /data/bios

Emulator for the Colecovision plus the
Super Game Module (SGM) and the MegaCart
for games larger than 32K.

This is a work-in-progress... more readme 
coming soon.

Thanks to Alekmaul who provided the 
baseline code to work with and to lobo
for the menu graphical design.

Special thanks to  Marat Fayzullin, as the 
author of ColEM which is the code for the 
core emulation (Z80, TMS9918 and SN76489).
I think the original port was circa ColEM 2.1
with some fixes incorproated from ColEM 2.9
